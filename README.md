This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the App
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app will reload if you make changes. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.
- Automatically reloads when changes are made.

### `npm test`
- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- For more details, see [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
- Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
- React is bundled in production mode and optimized for best performance.
- Minifies the build, with filenames including hashes.

### `npm run eject`
- Removes the single build dependency from the project.
- Copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) for full control.

**Warning:** Ejecting is irreversible. After ejecting, you maintain the setup yourself.
